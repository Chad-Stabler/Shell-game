## Making a plan
#HTML
--A section that holds all my tags and divs
--H1 introducing the game
--3 image elements containing shells
--3 image elements of a ball under each shell
-- p tags counting wins, losses, total and span over numbers for counter

#js
--grab dom elements
--event listener for button click that checks random number, reveals shell, iterates counter for wins, losses, total.
--repeat for each button

#css
--transform elements for reveal shells, maybe timeout if I get syntax
